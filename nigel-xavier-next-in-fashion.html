It showcases upcoming fashion designers aiming to win a <strong>$200,000</strong> reward but more significantly, the opportunity to become the next big thing in fashion by impressing expert judges.</p><p>The second season of Next in Fashion has a range of challenges that have as their themes monarchy, thrift, swimwear, and childhood. However, some claim that while it is unoffensive and has a supportive environment, audiences are likely to fall asleep unless they have a strong interest in fashion.</p><p>After eliminating 12 strong competitors and defeating <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Bao Tranchi</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Deontré Hancock</strong></a> in the Season 2 finale, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nigel Xavier</strong></a> was announced the winner of the second season. Of course, viewers have been obsessed with the Atlanta- based designer and want to know more about him, including his age. Well, we’ve got you covered.</p><p>Previously, we touched on <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>James Ford</strong></a>.</p><h2>Nigel Xavier From Next in Fashion Season 2: The Atlanta-Based Designer Was Declared the Winner of Season 2 After Defeating Deontré and Bao Tranchi in the Final!</h2><p>Fashion designer <strong>Nigel Xavier</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@nigelxavier_</a>) from Next in Fashion Season 2 moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in 2010. He has spent most of his life in Summerhill. The up-and-coming designer said in his Farfetch profile that living in Summerhill had given him access to opportunities that he never would have had otherwise. He played football in high school but decided against a sporting career to pursue fashion instead. Additionally, his age has not been revealed yet. However, some unverified sources claim that he is 24 years old in 2023.</p><p>Nigel not only designs but also fashions, models, and tailors clothing for his own collections. He draws influence from rappers like <strong>A$AP Rocky</strong>, <strong>Playboi Carti</strong>, and <strong>Travis Scott</strong> and is most recognized for his denim designs. Nigel is constantly focused on the upcoming design, and his personal favorite is a pair of giant, patchwork denim pants that can fit five to six people.</p><p>Additionally, Nigel Xavier recently got the chance to style the well-known rapper<strong> 2 Chainz</strong>. The majority of the styles and designs by the Atlanta-based designer are posted on his website <a href=# rel=noopener>Moonman</a>, where celebrities and fans may purchase a pair of unique retro styles.</p><p>Talking about his time on Next in Fashion, Nigel’s efforts as a contestant wowed both the hosts and the judges. The first task on the show had a royal theme, and the designer based his creation on his legendary streetwear royalty. As a result, traditional streetwear was presented in a regal manner, which soon won over onlookers—including the illustrious <strong>Donatella Versace</strong>. The third task of the season required the contestants to upcycle old clothing into eye-catching outfits.</p><p>Nigel Xavier stunned the spectators by creating a stunning appearance with jeans. This meant that he and <strong>Deontré Hancock</strong> shared first place. In episode 5, Nigel and <strong>Amari Carter</strong> again won the teamwork competition. By mixing denim and fringe in two fantastic ensembles, they impressed the judges. Finally, just Nigel, Deontré, and<strong> Bao Tranchi</strong> remained in the competition.</p><p>Nigel created designs that people couldn’t help but want to wear using his unique denim style since he understood how important it was for his final collection to reflect him. A majority of the judges agreed that the designer had crafted his own universe in the vein of ’90s hip-hop, and they were ready to be a part of it. In the end, he was declared the winner, a distinction he deserved for developing a modern range of vintage clothing that complemented his own style.</p><p>Nigel ultimately walked away with the title, <strong>$200,000</strong> in prize money, and an agreement with Rent The Runway. After winning the title, Nigel Xavier <a href=# rel=noopener>told</a>,</p><p><strong>Being able to win this whole thing, I just want people to remember that if you don’t feel like you belong, just make space, because there’s room, you know? I’m just super grateful. I can’t wait to show the world what I got next.</strong></p><p>Shortly after the show’s filming was finished, Nigel Xavier disclosed that he and three of the participants, <strong>Desyree</strong>, Deontre, and Amari, would be presenting a panel discussion on culture and diversity where each designer’s appearance will be highlighted.</p><p><strong>Keep reading <a href=#>Blurred Reality</a> for more <a href=#>fascinating stories</a> about your favorite shows.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianKq%2Fs7HDZqmemZyewbp6wqikaKaZnLKtedearaKdomK7psTTZqCnZZaWwKm1zqdm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./becca-tilley-reacts-to-ex-bf-robert-graham-dating-19-year-old.html>&#171;&nbsp;Becca Tilley Reacts to Ex-BF Robert Graham Dating 19-Year-Old</a>
