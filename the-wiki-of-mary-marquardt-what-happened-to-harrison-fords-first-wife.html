Mary Marquardt is of mixed Jewish, Irish, and German descent.</p><p>He attended Maine East High School in Park Ridge, Illinois, and later Ripon College, where he met his first wife. He studied philosophy, but in his senior year, he attended acting classes to overcome his timidity.</p><p>However, Ford became interested in performing and, after graduating from college, Harrison joined the Belfry Players.</p><h2><span id=What_happened_to_Harrison_Ford8217s_first_wife>What happened to Harrison Ford’s first wife?</span></h2><p>Following her divorce from Ford, Mary resumed her career as a chef and worked at her ex-husband Harrison Ford’s Culver City Filling Station.</p><p>Later, it was determined that she had multiple sclerosis, but there has been no word of her death since then. Nonetheless, she has faded into obscurity, maintained by her son, Benjamin Ford, who looks after her.</p><p>Wikimedia Commons has a page dedicated to Mary Marquardt’s age, childhood, and education.</p><p>Mary’s personal information is limited to the fact that she was born in 1945, somewhere in the United States; there is no information on her parents, such as their names or occupations.</p><p>After matriculation, she enrolled in the famous liberal arts Ripon College in Ripon, Wisconsin, for her studies. Her life altered when she met her first husband, Harrison Ford, in college.

He needed any employment to provide for his children and Mary.</p><p>Nonetheless, he had a big break when he auditioned for the role of Bob Falfa in George Lucas’ 1973 film “American Graffiti.</p><p>“He and Lucas became friends, and in 1977, Lucas offered him the lead part in “Star Wars.” Since then, Harrison has played Han Solo in every film in the saga, including “The Empire Strikes Back” (1980), “Return of the Jedi” (1983), and most recently “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”</p><p>His portrayal as Han Solo catapulted him to stardom, and he has since gone on to have a successful career as Indiana Jones in the “Indiana Jones” franchise, Rick Deckard in the “Blade Runner” film, and countless other roles.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Mary_Marquardt_start_her_Professional_Career>How did Mary Marquardt start her Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Following her education, Mary began her career as a chef, and as she and her husband’s careers progressed, they purchased restaurants across the United States, where she worked as a chef.</p><p>When they split, she remained in the post, with the assistance of her son Benjamin Ford.
