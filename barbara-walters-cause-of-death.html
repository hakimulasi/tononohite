Doubleday expressed interest in turning the article into a book in a letter she received not long after it was published.</p><p>For Walters, it would be beneficial for tongue-tied socially awkward people. <strong>In 1970, she collaborated with June Callwood as a ghostwriter to release the book How to Talk with Practically Anyone about Practically Anything. </strong>The book‚Äôs success came as a shock to Walters.

She said that she would be loyal to Cohn forever because of how he had helped her adopt her daughter Jacqueline. Walters writes in her autobiography that she is thankful to Cohn for defending her father in court.</p><p>Walters claims that her father had an arrest warrant for failure to appear because he missed a court date in New York while the family was vacationing in Las Vegas, but that Cohn was able to get the charge dropped.
