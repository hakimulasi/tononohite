She was a native of Brusly. Alicia Allain is also a hairstylist and music producer. Schneider met Alicia Allain back in 2015 as his professional manager.&nbsp;</p><p>She was also the owner of Maven <a href=#>Entertainment</a> and a producing partner. However, in 2019, John Schneider and Alicia Allain tied the knot at Schneider’s studios in Holden, Louisiana.</p><p>Allain served as John Schneider’s professional and personal manager and his producing partner. She also had film credits as an actress, producer, and makeup artist.</p><p>On Wednesday afternoon, Schneider shared the <a href=#>news</a> about his wife’s death, actress Alicia Allain. She battled cancer for several years but it was not the cause of death.&nbsp;</p><p>The cause of her death is still unknown. Her husband requested privacy in his hard times.</p><p>Schneider posted on his Facebook profile, <strong>“My beautiful Smile is pain free, living in her new body alongside Jesus. Please respect our privacy during this time of grief. Please do not ask any questions. If you have any pictures of us and our obvious love and adoration for each other, please post them below. Lastly… hug those you love tight and let them know how you feel. We always did.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Scheider is famously known for playing Bo Duke on “The Dukes of Hazzard,” which was released in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>The two had a wedding event “before God,” shortly followed by a legal union. To build John Schneider Studios in Louisiana, they worked together.</p><p>They together have developed and produced many film projects, among them dramas Like ‘Son,’ ‘Stand On It!,’ ‘Smokey and the Bandit,’ ‘Anderson Bench,’ ‘Poker Run,’ and movie ‘Christmas Cars’ and most recently, the American flag-focused ‘To Die For.’</p><p>In May 2019, she announced that she had been diagnosed with stage 3 HER2 negative cancer.&nbsp;Shortly after her diagnosis, the couple started looking into the best possible treatment options.</p><p>Furthermore, after nearly two years, in 2021, Schneider said that his life partner was now cancer-free.</p><p>He stated that Allain was doing great. She was her own most prominent advocate. Allain visited her doctor even after becoming cancer-free and was also on the Keto for a cancer diet.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, she looked at it as a maintenance program. She was remarkable and tenacious too.</p><p>Tom Wopat, “Dukes” co-star, also wrote to <a href=#>social media</a> to express his thoughts, <strong>“I didn’t get any details, but I don’t need any to be aware of the pain and loss that John’s dealing with,” Wopat said on Facebook. “My thoughts and prayers are with him, along with the thoughts and prayers of the entire Dukes nation. Alicia was a force in his life and his career, and she will be missed.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who was John Schneider’s wife, Alicia Allain?</h2><p>Alicia Allain was born in South Louisiana in 1969.
