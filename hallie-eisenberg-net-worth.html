She wasn't famous before the commercials so she likely had to work for a standard day rate which at the time wouldn't have been more than $5,000 or $10,000. On the flip side, as the star of a national commercial that aired many thousands of times, she earned a royalty every time the commercial aired. She likely earned several hundred thousand dollars, potentially as much as $1 million during her time with Pepsi alone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLWiuMuinGadmaiyr67Eq55mppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jennette-mccurdy-spoke-out-about-abusive-conduct-on-her-nickelodeon-sets.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jennette McCurdy Spoke Out About Abusive Conduct On Her Nickelodeon Sets</a>
