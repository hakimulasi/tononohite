A Look at His Dating History</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 12 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Josh Allen’s ex-girlfriend is Brittany Williams. The former couple met when they were kids and dated for some time. Josh was head over heels in love with Brittany before they parted ways afterward.</strong></p><p>Following his eventful romantic adventure with Brittany Williams, the American football quarterback for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League has turned his attention to someone else and is reported to be in love with actress Hailee Steinfeld.</p><h2><strong>Josh Allen and His Ex-Girlfriend, Brittany Williams, Met As Kids</strong></h2><p>As we have already started, Josh Allen and his ex-girlfriend, Brittany Williams, were head over heels in love before things went sour between them. Interestingly, they first met each other when they were still very little kids. The story of their connection traces back to their childhood days in Fresno, California, where their paths intertwined at a memorable event. During an appearance on Kelly Stafford’s podcast, The Morning After, Brittany nostalgically recounted the story of their initial encounter.</p><p>According to her, they met for the first time when they were both 8 years old. Their first meeting occurred when Brittany Williams attended a birthday celebration for Allen’s brother. Coincidentally, the festivities took place alongside a minor league baseball game, adding an extra layer of excitement to the gathering. As fate would have it, during the game, a player hit a ball that landed near the party.</p><p>In a heartwarming display of chivalry, a young Josh Allen took it upon himself to retrieve the stray ball and approached Brittany, offering it to her. However, in typical childhood fashion, she couldn’t help but feel a mix of embarrassment and playful reluctance, playfully exclaiming, “Oh my gosh, cooties!” This lighthearted exchange became a defining moment for both of them, etching a lasting memory in their hearts.</p><p>Despite being so young at the time, this encounter left an indelible impression on both Brittany and Josh, and it set the foundation for what was to later happen between them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Britta.jpg><h3><strong>Josh and Brittany Didn’t See Each Again Until They Were Teenagers</strong></h3><p>Following their initial encounter at the birthday party when they were 8 years old, Josh Allen and Brittany Williams did not see again for a long time. As a matter of fact, reports say they did not see each again until they had both become teenagers. But, despite their time apart, their mothers, who happen to know each other, managed to maintain a connection, keeping the possibility of rekindling their friendship alive.</p><p>It was around the age of 16 or 17 that fate brought them back together. At the time, Brittany, who was perusing a photo of the now-grown Allen online, couldn’t help but notice how attractive he had become. Unable to contain her admiration, she expressed her thoughts to her mother, who took it upon herself to reach out to Josh Allen’s mother, initiating their reunion. Incidentally, Allen was also thinking of Brittany and was longing to meet her someday again as well.</p><p>The long-awaited reunion took place at Allen’s family restaurant. Brittany and her friends had come to the restaurant and Allen was there as well. When they saw each other, Brittany, in a bold and spontaneous move, leaned in and planted a kiss on Allen in the parking lot, Allen recalls being very excited by this act and that it made him very shy. Following this, Williams and Allen remained in contact and talked regularly.</p><p>Brittany later invited Allen to a dance at her school but little did they know that this invitation would bring forth its own set of challenges. Allen, who was already feeling nervous about the event, was further made very uncomfortable by Brittany’s friends who came along to the event. Allen was so embarrassed by her friends that he felt completely out of place during the date.</p><h3><strong>Josh Stopped Talking to Brtianny For a Year After Their School Dance</strong></h3><p>Following the incident when Brittany Williams invited Josh Allen to her school dance, Josh suddenly stopped talking to Brittany. The embarrassment he was made to endure from Brittany’s friends is said to have contributed to his withdrawal. Reflecting on this challenging time, Brittany Williams candidly shared that Josh Allen essentially “ghosted” her for an entire year and did not talk to her at all during this time. Their once vibrant communication came to an abrupt halt, leaving her puzzled.</p><p>Josh Allen was more involved in his budding football career as he played football in high school. Brittany, however, displayed remarkable maturity and understanding. Despite the lack of communication, Brittany said held onto the belief that their relationship was not entirely over. She recognized that sometimes life’s circumstances and individual journeys align in ways that temporarily disrupt the course of love, and she respected Allen’s need for space during this period of introspection.</p><p>Throughout that year of silence, both Josh Allen and Brittany Williams continued to navigate their respective paths, and both went to different schools.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/brita-o.jpg><h3><strong>How They Reconnected and Resumed Talking</strong></h3><p>After a year of silence, fate intervened once again, bringing Josh Allen and Brittany Williams back into each other’s lives as college freshmen. Josh Allen explained later that he never stopped thinking of Brittany Williams even though he was not talking to her. But he was too shy to make a move after such a long time. He kept wondering how he would reconnect with her.</p><p>In the meantime, Brittany pursued her studies at California State University, Fresno, while Allen embarked on his educational journey at Reedley College, a two-year community college. One day, Josh, who could not bear it anymore, decided to send a text message to Brittany and apologize for keeping away in hopes of reuniting them. This move worked.</p><p>During an episode of Kelly Stafford’s podcast, The Morning After, Brittany Williams shared the story of their reunion and how she received Josh Allen’s text message. According to her, one day, out of the blue, she got an unexpected text message from Josh Allen, a whole year after their last communication. In the heartfelt text message, Josh admitted his mistake of not talking to her for a whole year. At the time, Brittany was dating another guy, but the text message reignited the spark they once shared.</p><p>Josh Allen and Brittany eventually got to meet face to face-again after Josh was invited to Brittany’s home. Brittany’s brother was having a graduation party, and Josh was invited to attend, and he accepted eagerly. Brittany explained that as Josh walked through the door, her heart skipped a beat, and she instinctively knew that they were meant to be together. The magnetic pull between Josh and Brittany was too strong to ignore, and it was not long before they started dating.</p><h3><strong>Josh Allen and Brittany Officially Began Dating in 2017</strong></h3><p>After several years of knowing each other, Josh Allen and Brittany Williams officially became a couple in 2017. In a beautiful twist of fate that same year, Allen was given a second chance to attend a dance with Brittany when she invited him to accompany her to her sorority formal, marking a memorable milestone in their evolving relationship.</p><p>From the very beginning, Brittany Williams proved to be a pillar of support and encouragement for Josh Allen’s football career.
