Here’s a look at Caitlyn Jenner’s kids’ lives.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Caitlyn_Jenner></span>Who Is Caitlyn Jenner?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Caitlyn Marie Jenner (born William Bruce Jenner; formerly known as <a href=#>Bruce Jenner</a> until 2015) is an American media personality and former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete. She was born on October 28, 1949, in Mount Kisco, New York, to parents Esther Ruth (née McGuire) and William Hugh Jenner.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/caitlyn.jpg><p>In her younger years, Caitlyn attended Graceland College (now Graceland University) in Lamoni, Iowa, and earned a football scholarship. Sadly, she was forced to stop playing football because of a knee injury. The Graceland track coach L. D. Weldon encouraged her to switch to the decathlon as he believed she had the potential for success.&nbsp;</p><p>Caitlyn debuted as a decathlete in 1970 in the Drake Relays decathlon in Des Moines, Iowa, finishing in fifth place. Jenner graduated from Graceland College in 1973 with a degree in physical education.</p><p>She went on to win a couple of big awards for her country and broke some world records making her a decorated Olympic athlete.&nbsp;It is important to note that Caitlyn’s Olympic events were men’s events that occurred before her gender transition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bruce-running.jpg><p>In a 20/20 television <a href=#>interview</a> in April 2015, Caitlyn came out as a trans woman explaining how she had dealt with gender dysphoria since she was young. She underwent cosmetic surgery and completed sex reassignment surgery in January 2017.</p><p>In September 2015, her name was legally changed to ‘Caitlyn Marie Jenner,’ and her gender to female.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Caitlyn_Jenners_Six_Kids></span>Meet Caitlyn Jenner’s Six Kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Caitlyn has six biological children with three different women. They are Burton, Cassandra, Brandon, Brody, Kendall, and Kylie Jenner.

He is also a professional truck racer and has loved racing since his dad took him go-karting as a child. Caitlyn had a strained relationship with her eldest son after her third marriage, but the two have reconnected and have been on good terms since her transition in 2015.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cassandra_%E2%80%98Casey_Jenner></span>Cassandra ‘Casey’ Jenner<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Caitlyn and Chrystie’s second child, Cassandra Jenner (now Cassandra Marino), was born on June 10, 1980, when her parents were in the middle of a divorce, and Caitlyn was not present for the birth in L.A.&nbsp;</p><p>Cassandra is now an interior designer and married to her husband, Micheal Marino. She has three children and keeps her life very private. She also had a strained relationship with Caitlyn in her early years, but the two have since reconnected and are working on improving their relationship.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brandon_Jenner></span>Brandon Jenner<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Brandon is Caitlyn’s third child but first with her second wife, Linda Thompson, an actress and songwriter.

Brandon is a singer and songwriter with over a million followers on Instagram, sharing updates on his new music with his fans.&nbsp;</p><p>He has been married twice and has three children. Like Burt and Cassandra, Brandon has described his relationship with Caitlyn as once strained. He has also been reported to be mending his relationship with Caitlyn in recent years.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brody_Jenner></span>Brody Jenner<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Brody is Caitlyn and Linda’s second child and her fourth biological child.

Kendall Nicole Jenner was born on November 3, 1995, in L.A.&nbsp;</p><p>Kendall has become a fashion icon and a reality star from her appearances on the popular “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” She is now one of the world’s most popular and most-paid supermodels. Kendall has always described herself as a “daddy’s girl,” having a great relationship with Caitlyn from birth.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BRUCE-AND-KIDS.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kylie_Jenner></span>Kylie Jenner<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Probably the most popular of the Jenner children, <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> was born on August 10, 1997, in L.A.
