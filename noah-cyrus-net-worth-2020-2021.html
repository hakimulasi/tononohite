singer like her.</p><p>Maybe you know about Noah Cyrus every well but do you know how old and tall is she and what is her net worth in 2024? If you do not know, we have prepared this article about details of Noah Cyrus’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>Noah Cyrus was born to Billy Ray Cyrus and Leticia Cryus, alias Tish Cyrus. She has two siblings, and her elder sister Miley Cyrus is a famous actor-singer. Her brother is called Braison Cyrus. Billy Ray is a well-known country singer and actor. Noah was born on 8 January 2000. Her half-siblings are Brandi, Chris, and Christopher. As a child, she was exposed to the world of entertainment quite early in life. Growing up in a farmhouse that is almost 500 acres, Noah experienced every bit of luxury that comes with fame.</p><p>In a way, her breakthrough into the world of entertainment was facilitated by the fact that she came from the famous Cyrus family. From childhood, she was groomed to be a performer. While children her age were still figuring out alphabets, Noah was already a child artist at the age of three. &nbsp;Noah was enrolled in San Fernando Valley School to take a formal education but later dropped out as she was already occupied with performances and shows, relying mostly on homeschooling thereafter.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Just 24-year-old Noah Cyrus has been in the news for her dating life and controversies surrounding it. When Noah was just seven years, she started dating Frankie Jonas, the youngest of the Jonas Brothers. Given that both were really kids, it was more like childhood romance that did not culminate into anything serious, and pair parted ways in 2009.</p><p>After a hiatus of nine years, Noah again delved headlong into dating. This time it was Lil Xan (Diego Leanos). The couple were all over Instagram when they were in a relationship and later, when things went awry. Initially, their public display of affection was fodder for the paparazzi. Equally interesting and loud was their Insta battle over who ditched whom, with fans of each one of them supporting their respective stars. On 20 August 2018, they even released the song “Live or Die” together. Xan went overboard with making Noah’s father’s birthday special by gifting him a bong and rolling paper for his birthday.</p><p>When the PDA had become quite the norm, and shutterbugs had mellowed down a bit, Xan broke the equilibrium with an accusation on Instagram, blaming Noah on cheating on him. There was a lot of mud-slinging with both parties sharing personal texts and photographs on Insta to prove their point. After a lot of drama on Instagram, the couple split up in 2019. From then on, Noah is single, and there is no news of her dating anybody yet.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 8 January 2000, Noah Cyrus is 24 years old as of today’s date 22nd July 2024.
